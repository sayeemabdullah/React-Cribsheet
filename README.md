# React-Cribsheet

> React is a **JavaScript library** for building User interfaces(UI). The heart of React application is **component**. Component is a piece of UI. A tree of components makes a complete UI. In the root of the tree is the main component (App). A component is implemented as a JavaScript class with some states and render. So after [CSS Cribsheet](https://github.com/sayeemabdullah/CSS-Cribsheet) this is another initiative to make small notes on React which may help me or anyone else in the future. 

Before starting React we have to download and install **Node js** and **NPM**. As I use Linux, I  used the following commands :

``` shell

$ sudo apt install nodejs
$ sudo apt install npm

```
